Well , let’s just say it’s doing none of the three things above . In fact it’s doing the opposite . After the energy
industry , the global food system is the second biggest contributor to climate change . It’s also the single biggest cause
of biodiversity loss , deforestation , drought and freshwater pollution . Apart from the devastating impact these are
having on our landscape and wildlife , they in turn threaten our food security and – directly and indirectly – our
health . Extreme weather events mean harvest failures . Polluted waters mean disease. And given that over 40% of today’s
medicines are extracted from plants, micro-organisms or animals , the loss of biodiversity means the loss of untold
medical potential – not to mention culinary potential .
